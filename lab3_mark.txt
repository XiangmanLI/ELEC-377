Comments:
The code compiles and works. 
The test and code docs are ok. But it seems you had merge conflict when pushing your files, so I can't understand what happened. Also the code doc should have some structure, and also explain common.c as well.
Detailed comment blocks should be placed before functions, not inside them. Also they are missing in common.c
